<h2>About me</h2>
<p>
    A 4th year student from Istanbul Technical University Industri Engineering department. Former supply chain intern at Haleon Turkey. 
    I am a disciplined and detail-oriented individual with a strong passion for research and planning. My curiosity drives me to
    deeply explore every project, while my analytical mindset helps me develop efficient solutions. Combining these qualities, I
    thrive in environments where structured problem-solving and innovative thinking are essential. I am interested in all areas of technology, 
    but I am also interested in data analytics, artificial intelligence and software development due to my undergraduate education.
</p>
<p>
    Other than professional carrier I am a sociable and easy-to-communicate person. I played basketball at a professional level for many 
    years, played the guitar and took part in ITU Entrepreneurship Club, one of the biggest university clubs in Turkey. These have improved 
    my teamwork and leadership skills.
